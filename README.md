# rnnops

A suite of tools for manipulating recurrent neural networks. In development.

I hope to eventually include the following functionality:

- Network training via backprop
- Network construction via low-rank and pseudoinverse methods
- Network surgery
- Fixed point finding
- Task-preserving rank reduction
- Task-preserving synaptic balancing
